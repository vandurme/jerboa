Jerboa is a package for prototyping randomized/streaming algorithms and data
structures, primarily intended for HLT applications. As of the time of this
writing much of the library is Java-based: not for efficiency, but for ease of
integration in other research NLP projects. C versions exist for some subsets of
the library, which may be distributed in the future.

I am unlikely to respond to emails asking for support, but if you feel you've
discovered a bug (not too unlikely), or have something you'd like to contribute,
then feel free to issue a pull request via GitHub.
